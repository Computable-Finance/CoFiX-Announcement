# About Repurchase

When the user uses the CoFiX protocol, a certain transaction fee will be locked in the CoFiX DAO;

CoFiX Repurchase means that users can exchange COFI Token and DAO contract transactions into ETH, thus reducing the circulation of COFI Token and enhancing its intrinsic value.

CoFiX DAO contract address: 0x278f5d08bEa1989BEfcC09A20ad60fB39702D556
