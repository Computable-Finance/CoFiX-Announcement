# About Repurchase

The CoFiX V2 version has been officially launched for more than a week, and the arbitrage mining and hedging mining functions have also been opened simultaneously. The COFI repurchase will be officially launched at 12 o'clock on May 29, 2021, UTC time and the team is actively preparing for it. In this repurchase, users will be able to sell COFI to DAO based on the equilibrium price quoted by the NEST oracle (when the difference between the latest effective price of COFI quoted by NEST oracle and the average price exceeds 5%, the repurchase will not be executed). Each block releases 50 COFI repurchase quotas, and as the blocks accumulate, it will not increase after each time it is accumulated to 15000 COFI (each time someone buys back a part and continues to release up to the total amount of 300 blocks) ), the COFI after the repurchase is temporarily stored for future destruction. It should be noted that for each repurchase operation, the repurchaser needs to pay the cost of calling the NEST oracle.
